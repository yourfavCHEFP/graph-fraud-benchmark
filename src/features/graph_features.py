Phase 10.9 - Graph Fraud Feature Engineering.

Build transaction-level graph features.

CRITICAL FIX (mentor review, item 1): this file previously read graph.x
by hardcoded column position under a comment claiming:

    0 node_type_id
    1 degree
    2 transaction_entity_count
    3 log_transaction_amount
    4 card_degree
    5 email_degree
    6 device_degree
    7 address_degree

But src/graph/pyg_converter.py -- the file that actually produces
graph.x -- places the columns in a DIFFERENT order:

    0 degree
    1 transaction_entity_count
    2 log_transaction_amount
    3 card_degree
    4 email_degree
    5 device_degree
    6 address_degree
    7 node_type_id

Every column read here was off by one relative to the real layout. Most
seriously, `address_degree = x[:, 7]` was actually reading node_type_id
(a categorical 0/1/2/3 label), not a real degree count -- meaning
`log_address_degree`, `entity_degree_min` (via the entity_stack min),
and `address_ratio` were all computed from a node-type label, and
`transaction_amount` (`amount = x[:, 3]`) was actually reading
card_degree instead of log_transaction_amount.

FIX: column positions are now looked up BY NAME from
src.graph.pyg_converter.FEATURE_COLUMNS -- the single authoritative
schema -- instead of being hardcoded twice in two files that can (and
did) silently drift apart. An assertion at import time fails loudly if
that schema ever changes shape without this file being updated to match.

Features (unchanged output contract -- same 16 names/order as before):
    0 transaction_amount
    1 log_card_degree
    2 log_email_degree
    3 log_device_degree
    4 log_address_degree
    5 entity_degree_mean
    6 entity_degree_max
    7 entity_degree_min
    8 entity_degree_std
    9 card_ratio
    10 email_ratio
    11 device_ratio
    12 address_ratio
    13 entity_concentration
    14 degree_imbalance
    15 hub_entity_count

No fraud labels are used.
No global dataset statistics are used.
