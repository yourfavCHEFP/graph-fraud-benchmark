FIX (mentor review item 9): now uses the get_predictor dependency
(deployment/fastapi/services/inference.py) instead of a bare module
function call, and every HTTPException detail is a fixed, generic,
caller-safe message -- the real exception text is logged server-side
only (logger.exception), never returned in the response body. Previously
`str(exc)` was returned directly to callers, which can leak filesystem
paths or internal exception text (mentor review items 6 and 9).

Status code contract (mentor review item 9):
    Valid transaction ID                -> 200
    Out-of-range transaction ID         -> 400
    Malformed request body              -> 422 (Pydantic, via PredictionRequest)
    Predictor unavailable               -> 503 (raised by the get_predictor
                                            dependency itself, before this
                                            function's body ever runs)
    Unexpected internal failure         -> 500, generic message
