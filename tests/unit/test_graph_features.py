"""
Regression test for the critical feature-column misalignment bug
(mentor review, item 1 / item 32).

src/features/graph_features.py used to read graph.x by hardcoded column
POSITION under a comment describing a column order that did not match
what src/graph/pyg_converter.py actually produces -- every feature was
silently off by one column, and address_degree was actually reading
node_type_id (a categorical label, not a degree count).

This test builds a small synthetic graph with KNOWN, DISTINCT values in
each column (following pyg_converter.FEATURE_COLUMNS' real order) and
asserts that build_graph_features() reads each source column correctly
by value, not just by shape. If the column contract in pyg_converter.py
ever changes without this file being updated to match, this test fails
loudly instead of silently producing wrong features again.
